# Keras-tensorflow-porfolio-development-AI
"This program utilizes the power of Keras and TensorFlow to train on historical Forex data and make predictions about future market trends. 
The GPU acceleration allows for quick and efficient training, enabling the program to make real-time predictions. The program also uses Flask to connect to a local server, where it outputs data based on statistical probabilities of an asset going up or down. The predictions can then be used to manage a portfolio on various timeframes, from minute to daily, using Flask's GET commands to interface with the MetaTrader suite. This program provides a powerful and automated solution for Forex traders, helping to maximize profits and minimize risk."
